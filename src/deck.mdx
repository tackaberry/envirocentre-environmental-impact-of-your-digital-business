- On-site technology or appliances
- Transportation to or from work
- Remote working: https://www.envirocentre.ca/what-if-remote-work-became-the-new-normal/

# Number 1: Email

- Emails are very waseful
- Every email is sent, scanned for viruses, stored, downloaded to devices... Printed?!
- Don't forget spam

---

An average spam email: 0.3 g CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent)

A standard email: 4 g CO2e

An email with ‚Äúlong and tiresome attachments‚Äù: 50 g CO2e

\*\*\* Taken from Mike Berners-Lee: ‚ÄòHow Bad are Bananas?: The Carbon Footprint of Everything‚Äô (2010).

# Unnecessary emails

Say you send 10 "Thank you" emails per week...
(we all do this)
30M Canadians using email
40 tonnes of CO2e per day in Canada
... just from "Thank you" emails

---

# What else?

- no thank you emails, only copy people that are needed, dont forward
- clean your mailing lists
- unsubscribe your self
- link to files instead of sending attachments
- Use chat apps (Slack, Teams, Discord)
