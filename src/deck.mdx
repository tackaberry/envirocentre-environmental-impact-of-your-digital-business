# What it isnt?

- Office heating, electricity or utilities of your business
- On-site technology or appliances
- Transportation to work
- Remote working ([An article on EnviroCentre.ca](https://www.envirocentre.ca/what-if-remote-work-became-the-new-normal/) by Mike Gifford)

# \#1. Email

</LayoutColor>

---

# Emails are very wasteful

- Every email is sent to all recipients
- Scanned for viruses
- Stored... forever
- Downloaded to devices...
- Printed?!
- There's also spam, newsletters, auto-replies, notifications

---

## An average spam email: 0.3 g CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent)

## A standard email: 4 g CO2e

## An email with ‚Äúlong and tiresome attachments‚Äù: 50 g CO2e

<Footnote>

Taken from Mike Berners-Lee: [‚ÄòHow Bad are Bananas?: The Carbon Footprint of Everything‚Äô (2010)](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/how-bad-are-bananas-the/9781553658313-item.html).

# Unnecessary emails

### ‚Ü™ Say you send 10 "Thank you" emails per week... (we all do this)

### ‚Ü™ Say 30M Canadians using email

### ‚áâ 40 tonnes of CO2e per day in Canada

... just from "Thank you" emails

---

# What you can do tomorrow

- Only copy people that are needed, dont forward
- Clean your mailing lists
- Unsubscribe yourself
- Link to files instead of sending attachments
- Use chat apps (Slack, Teams, Discord)

---

<LayoutColor color="#6b393f">

# \#2. Data tracking

</LayoutColor>

---

# Turn on strict tracking protection

- Stop pervasive tracking and collection of personal data
- Most popular browsers have some form of anti-tracking or content-blocking
- BitDefender anti-tracking

---

<Split>

# Bit Defender<br />Anti-tracking

<Image src={Antitracker} style={{ height: "550px", width: "800px" }} />

</Split>

---

# Behind the scenes

- Blocking the content from downloading
- Reducing the constant flow of your personal data as you interact with the site

---

<LayoutColor color="#6b393f">

# \#3. Your website

</LayoutColor>

---

## The internet consumes over 1M MWh per day.

## From the data centre to networks to the devices

## It all consumes elctricity and in turn produces carbon emissions

<div style={{width:"1000px"}}>

# The 3 things you need to do to make your website more green

- Limit and improve big bulky images - Size them appropriately
